<h1>Critical Race Theory is literally the RNC's boogieman</h1>
<h2>in other words, in schools it doesn't exist. it's literally a sociological framework. what they're really targetting is history.<br>that's not very cool. so let's get in the way of those efforts, yeah?</h2>
<hr class="rounded">
<p>this website autogenerates randomized reports to their whistleblower email. the reports aren't real of course, they're mostly song lyrics.<br>just click the button below and send the email :)<br>alternatively, you could replace my message with a new one. feel free to spice it up!</p>
<a class="btn btn-warning" href="" id="email" target="_">click me!</a>
<p>now let's say, hypothetically, you want to send more randomized emails. each time you refresh the page, you'll get a new email template. i promise you wont get the same result; there's over a decillion combinations.</p>
